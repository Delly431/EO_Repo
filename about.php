<h1>Exiled Order History</h1><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exiled Order was established in October 2014, and was known as an ArmA 3 community. We were known as a strict Mil-Sim unit, but quickly realized we wanted to create something
even bigger than what we had envisioned. Exiled Orderâ€™s Research and Development section was on a mission to find the next big thing, and we quickly came to the conclusion that it was SQUAD. As SQUAD 
was being developed we continue to observe and follow knowing that this was going to be our big break. Our current plan for SQUAD is the run it in two different styles, Mil-Sim to experience an enriched
setting of immersion of tactical gameplay and teamwork, and a casual side for our everyday players who just want a place to call home.
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With SQUAD coming to steam as an early release we picked up a variety of other games to support Exiled Order aswell. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, War Thunder, and World of
Warcraft were on our minds, and we have continue to help support and grow those games with the help of our members. Exiled Order currently has played in two season of CS:GO and will continue to embark 
on our competitive journey with SQUAD and CS:GO.
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that SQUAD has come to steam and Exiled Order has picked up a server we have grown at a rate we could not have even imagined. With the community growing everyday we have had 
to open multiple squads to accommodate the growing numbers. What the Administration and Staff at Exiled Order has envisioned in 2014 has slowly and will continue to grow over the coming years.
<br /><br />
Thank you and enjoy your time from the family of Exiled Order.

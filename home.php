            <h1>Major Update!</h1>
            As most of you know, our website has been down for the past couple of days. We have recently switched to a more reliable hosting company we apologize for the inconvenience. The Leadership, Administrators 
            and a few members have been working around the clock in order to restore our amazing website again. At this current time we request that you re-register and for any new potential Prospects of Exiled Order 
            we ask that you continue to be patient while we are remaking our formats for this new change.<br /><br />
     
            Applications are now OPEN! Click <a href="http://exiledorder.com/forums/index.php?/forum/28-apply-here/">here</a> to apply<br /><br />
     
            TLDR: Our told hosting company was complete crap and so we got a new one. We lost all of our hard work from the old database but that will not stop us from re-building!
